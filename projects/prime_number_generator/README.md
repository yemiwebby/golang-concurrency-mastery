# Concurrent Prime Number Generator – Overview & Requirements

## Project Overview

This project implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes in a concurrent way using Go’s goroutines and channels. The generator starts from 2 and continuously filters out multiples of each discovered prime by creating a pipeline of filter goroutines. This design not only efficiently produces prime numbers but also demonstrates key concepts in concurrent programming, such as pipelines, dynamic goroutine creation, and channel-based communication.

## Challenge

Before diving into the implementation, try solving the problem yourself!

Your Task:
Implement a concurrent prime number generator in Go using goroutines and channels. The generator should:

Start from 2 and dynamically filter out non-prime numbers.
Use channels to pass numbers through different filtering stages.
Continuously generate prime numbers until a stop condition is met.

Bonus:

Implement a graceful shutdown mechanism.
Add configurable limits to control the number of primes generated.
Once you've given it a shot, check out the existing implementation to compare approaches!

## **Features**

**Concurrent Pipeline:**

- Each prime discovered spawns a new goroutine to filter its multiples.

  **Dynamic Filter Stages:**

- The pipeline automatically expands as new primes are discovered.

  **Channel-Based Communication:**

- Uses channels to seamlessly pass numbers between stages.

  **Scalable & Efficient:**

- Designed to run indefinitely or up to a configurable limit.

  **Graceful Shutdown:**

- Provides mechanisms to terminate the generator cleanly.

  **Detailed Logging:**

- Logs each stage of number filtering and prime discovery for easy debugging.

## ** Running the Project**

Ensure you have Go installed (`go version` to check).  
Then, run:

```sh
go run main.go
```

This command starts the prime number generator, which outputs primes to the console.

- Running Tests
  To verify functionality and check for race conditions, run:

```sh
go test -race -v .
```

This command:

- Runs all unit tests
- Detects race conditions
- Provides verbose output for debugging
