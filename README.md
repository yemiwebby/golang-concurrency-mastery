# 🚀 Hands-on Projects to Master Concurrency in Golang

Welcome to the **"Hands-on Projects to Master Concurrency in Golang"** repository! This collection of projects is designed to help you **develop expertise in Go’s concurrency model** by working through classic computer science challenges. The repository will be continuously updated with more projects, including real-world applications.

Each project is **self-contained**, includes unit tests, and demonstrates different concurrency patterns such as **goroutines, channels, worker pools, mutexes, and rate limiting**.

## 📌 **Project List**

Each project is located inside the `projects/` directory and contains its own `README.md`, `go.mod`, and source code.

### ** Classic Concurrency Challenges**

1. **[Producer-Consumer Problem](projects/producer_consumer/)** – Implements a producer-consumer system using Go channels with buffering and rate limiting.
2. **[Parallel Web Scraper](projects/web_scraper/)** – A concurrent web crawler with worker pools and controlled parallelism.
3. **[Dining Philosophers Problem](projects/dining_philosophers/)** – A classic synchronization problem using goroutines and mutexes.
4. **[Concurrent Prime Number Generator](projects/prime_number_generator/)** – Implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes in a concurrent way.
5. **[Parallel Merge Sort](projects/parallel_merge_sort/)** – A merge sort algorithm that sorts subarrays in parallel.
